# OVERVIEW

![Responsive Admin panel Design](/assets/imgs/preview.png)

***
As a software developer looking for a fullstack role, one thing that you see very often
on jobs' description is that the candidate should possess good abilities and good eyes
for ***attractive design***, while keeping it useful and ***accessible (responsive)*** for all viewports. It is with
that strong focus in mind that I decided to make this design essentially using **HTML**, **CSS** and
**JAVASCRIPT**.

## Key Takeaway:
- This project was a great reminder on how to use flex and grid container to lay out items accurately
on the screen
```
  display: flex;
  display: grid;
```
- Also I wasn't very comfortable working with media queries before this. So it ended up being a great
and fun learning experience setting up media queries and subsequent code for different viewports
```
  @media (min-width: 992px) {
    rules to be applied here once the viewport size falls below 992px of width.
  }
```
- Another great reminder was how to use Javascript to interact with dom elements.
For example, to set up a toggle based on an element having a specific class or not... class that
we attribute or remove based on certain events being triggered.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## What's next ?
Next I plan to learn more and dive deeper in media queries and mobile-first design, also 
sharpen my skills when it comes to css by learning some popular and useful libraries that the job market
requests.
